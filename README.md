## What is it
While playing turn-based online games, it is sometimes irritating to have to DM the next person after you've finished your move.
This hacky solution utilises [Telegram WebApps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) to give you a simple button.

The beauty of it is that it doesn't require anything to be running in the background.

## How to use
* Game host opens [this page](https://55AAh.github.io/unciv_notifier_bot_proxy/host);
* Each players messages [@unciv_notifier_bot](https://t.me/unciv_notifier_bot?start=true) to join the lobby;
* Host rearranges the order of players (drag with mouse) and starts the game;
* Each player clicks the button after the move is finished - this notifies the next player.

Enjoy!
